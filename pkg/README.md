**Online version**: https://spritefusion.com/pixel-snapper

A tool to snap pixels to a perfect grid. Designed to fix messy and inconsistent pixel art generated by AI.

## Why ?

**Current AI image models can't understand grid-based pixel art.**

- Pixel are inconsistent in size and position.
- The grid resolution can drift over time.
- Colors are not tied to a strict palette.

**With Pixel Snapper:**

- ✅ Pixel are snapped to a perfect grid.
- ✅ The grid resolution is consistent and can be scaled to pixel resolution.
- ✅ Colors are tied to a strict, quantized palette.

## Perfect for

- **AI generated pixel art** that needs to be snapped to a grid.
- **Procedural 2D art that doesn't fit a grid** like tilemaps or isometric maps.
- **2D game assets and 3D textures** that need to be perfectly scalable.
